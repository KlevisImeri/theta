This project wraps the [JavaSMT solver wrapper](https://github.com/sosy-lab/java-smt) into our common interfaces for solvers (located in the [solver](../solver) project).
Normally, only the factory class should be used from this project to instantiate a new solver and then the common interfaces should be preferred.
